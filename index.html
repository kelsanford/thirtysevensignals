									<h4>Useful is forever</h4>
										<p>
											Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.
										</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>2</h3>
									<h4>Great Service is Everything</h4>
										<p>
											We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.

							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>3</h3>
									<h4>Clarity is king</h4>
										<p>
											Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.
										</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>4</h3>
									<h4>Our customers are our investors</h4>
										<p>
											Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.
										</p>

								<h3>5</h3>
									<h4>The basics are beautiful</h4>
										<p>
											We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.

									<h4>Software should be easy</h4>
										<p>
											Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.
										</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>8</h3>
									<h4>Long-term contracts are obscene</h4>
										<p>
											No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.
